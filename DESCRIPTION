Title: Smoothing by Adaptive Shrinkage in R
Version: 1.3-10
Date: 2025-11-30
Description: Fast, wavelet-based Empirical Bayes shrinkage methods for
    signal denoising, including smoothing Poisson-distributed data and
    Gaussian-distributed data with possibly heteroskedastic error. The
    algorithms implement the methods described Z. Xing, P. Carbonetto & 
    M. Stephens (2021) <https://jmlr.org/papers/v22/19-042.html>.
