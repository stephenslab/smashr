Title: Smoothing by Adaptive Shrinkage in R
Version: 1.2-7
Date: 2019-11-19
Description: Fast, wavelet-based Empirical Bayes shrinkage methods for
    signal denoising, including smoothing Poisson-distributed data and
    Gaussian-distributed data with possibly heteroskedastic error. The
    algorithms implement the methods described Z. Xing & M. Stephens,
    2016 <arXiv:1605.07787>.
